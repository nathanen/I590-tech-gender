This syllabus is for a graduate seminar (I590) on technology and gender that I offered for the Informatics department of the Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering.  This syllabus grows out of my long-term research interest in the history of women in computing, but also includes the emerging literature on masculinity and computing and queer computing.
