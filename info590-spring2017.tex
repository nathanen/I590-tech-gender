\title{Technology \& Gender}
\begin{document}

\maketitle
In this seminar we will explore the literature on the history of gender
and technology, with a particular focus on information technology. From
the "computer girls" of the early 20th century to the hyper-masculine
culture of contemporary computing, ideas about gender have reflected and
transformed our understanding of sexuality and gender. Our goal in this
seminar is to survey the best of the emerging literature on gender and
computing, with an eye towards the practical application of gender
theory into your future research projects.

\textbf{Course Schedule}\\

In addition to doing the required readings and preparing for
discussions, you will be responsible for writing a short (1-2 pg)
reading response paper each week.\\

The supplementary readings and extended bibliography are meant to make
you aware of the larger literature, and to provide a guide for those of
you who need further preparation for your qualifying exams or
dissertation research.\\

A note on books: all of the articles listed below will be made available
electronically. The books you are responsible for borrowing, purchasing,
or otherwise acquiring. I did not order them via the bookstore, as in
most cases you can find better bargains elsewhere.

\label{sec:org06c4570}

For further development of her argument on the (lack of)
industrialization in female domestic work, see \cite{Cowan:1983vm}.
\cite{Lerman:1997ui} provides an introduction to their influential
special issue of \emph{Technology \& Culture} on women and technology in which
the Oldenziel article above first appeared.

\label{sec:org49f48ca}

\fullcite{Strom:1992wx}

\subsection{Supplemental Readings}
\label{sec:org8ba39b4}

\cite{Davies:1982vb} focuses on the typewriter as a gendered technology.
\cite{Milkman:1987tl} argues that women do not replace men during war;
new and gendered positions are created for them. \cite{Benson:1987wl}
describes women's work in retail. \cite{Tone:2001to} is a history of
birth control, and includes a section on female entrepreneurs in this
technology.

\subsection{Supplemental Readings}
\label{sec:org34ba31d}

Both \cite{Ensmenger:2010te} and \cite{Abbate:2012wq} cover the
analogous story of the development of computer programming in the United
States during this period. \cite{Agar:2003wf}, while not explicitly
about gender, provides the context for the turn towards "machinic"
thinking in the British Civil Service.

\section{February 22}

For other accounts of the roles that women played in the early computer
industry, see \cite{Shetterly:2016vl}, \cite{Grier:2005tq}, and
\cite{Gurer:1996it}.

\section{March 1}
\label{sec:org772020a}

\fullcite{Lagesen:2008vy}; \fullcite{Ensmenger:2015wx}

\subsection{Supplemental Readings}
\label{sec:org1d0b33c}

\cite{Kidder:1981tj} was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for its gripping
tale of computer engineers as Wild West heroes. \cite{Kocurek:2015cg}
provides the larger context for understanding masculinity and video
games. \cite{Losse:2012um} updates these narratives for the Facebook
era. If you have trouble understanding Haraway, read
\cite{Gibson:1995un}, which covers some of the same territory in the
form cyberpunk science fiction. In fact, read the Gibson anyway. It is
beautiful, insightful, and powerfully influential in its own right.

\section{March 8}
\label{sec:org8c716e9}

\fullcite{Hayles:2008wq}

\subsection{Supplemental Readings}
\label{sec:org8efb12c}

For more on the relationship between embodiment and virtuality, see \cite{Stone:1996wp} and \cite{Balsamo:1996uc}.  For an overview of the history of cybernetics and its relationship to contemporary information technology, see \cite{Kline:2015ti}.  For an interesting foreshadowing of our section on queer computing, \cite{Wilson:2009wm} explores the ``confluence of sexual and intellectual matters'' that swirled around the tragic genius Walter Pitts, one of the key members of the early Cybernetics group. And in case you were not intrigued enough by last weeks's discussion to read Gibson's \emph{Neuromancer}, read it now.
